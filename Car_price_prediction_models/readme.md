#### Title
- Car price prediction models
- Training project from Yandex Practicum (INO СPE «Yandex EdTEch»), Data Scientist specialist
#### Description of the project
- Dataset: CSV from sale of used cars service, historical data: technical specifications, equipment and prices of cars, ets
- Task: to build a model for prediction of car price  
- Regression task
- For customer was important: model studying speed, model prediction speed, quality of prediction
- Dataset with numeric and text features
#### Main tools 
- Jupiter notebook, Python and Markdown
- Markdown notes on Russian
####  Machine Learning tools  
- ML models LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, CatBoostRegressor, StandardScaler, ltb
- ML metrics accuracy_score, mean_squared_error
#### Conclusions
- The project is completed
- Different Machine learning models were trained and compared, the model with the best metric was selected
- The selected Machine learning model was tested on a test dataset
- Required metric was reached
