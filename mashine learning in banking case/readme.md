#### Title
- Mashine learning in banking case: customer churn
- Training project from Yandex Practicum (INO СPE «Yandex EdTEch»), Data Scientist specialist
#### Description of the project
- Dataset: CSV (10,000 rows) with bank customers features
- Task: to build a model for prediction customer churn  
- Classification task
- For customer was important: quality of prediction (F1-measure > 0,59)
- Dataset with numeric and text features
#### Main tools 
- Jupiter notebook, Python and Markdown
- Markdown notes on Russian
####  Machine Learning tools  
- ML models RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, DummyClassifier, StandardScaler
- ML metrics accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, recall_score, precision_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score,roc_curve, precision_recall_curve
- Sklearn.utils.shuffle
#### Conclusions
- The project is completed
- Dataset was prepared in order to create more representative training and testing sets.
- Different Machine learning models were trained and compared, the model with the best metric was selected
- The selected Machine learning model was tested on a test dataset
- Required metric was reached
