#### Title
- Mashine learning in business case: predictions for oil mining company 
- Training project from Yandex Practicum (INO СPE «Yandex EdTEch»), Data Scientist specialist
#### Description of the project
- Datasets: 3 CSV datasets with oil samples in three regions: in each of 10,000 fields
- Task: determine the region where mining will bring the most profit  
- Regression task
- For customer was important: to analyze possible profits and risks using the Bootstrap technique, quality of prediction
- 3 dataset with numeric and text features
#### Main tools 
- Jupiter notebook, Python and Markdown
- Markdown notes on Russian
####  Machine Learning tools  
- ML models LinearRegression
- ML metrics accuracy_score, mean_squared_error
#### Conclusions
- The project is completed
- Machine learning models for 3 regions were trained and compared
- Bootstrap function was applied for each region dataset, with 1000 samples, were calculated the average profit, 95% confidence interval and risk of loss 
- The best region was selected
- Required metric was reached
