#### Title
- Mashine learning - behavior of customers and tariffs 
- Training project from Yandex Practicum (INO СPE «Yandex EdTEch»), Data Scientist specialist
- Basic traning project, not advanced 
#### Description of the project
- Dataset: CSV with data on the behavior of customers and tariffs
- Task: to build a model for classification of tariffs  
- Classification task
- For customer was important: quality of prediction
- Dataset with numeric features
#### Main tools 
- Jupiter notebook, Python and Markdown
- Markdown notes on Russian
####  Machine Learning tools  
- ML models RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, DummyClassifier
- ML metrics accuracy_score
#### Conclusions
- The project is completed
- Different Machine learning models were trained and compared, the model with the best metric was selected
- The selected Machine learning model was tested on a test dataset
- Required metric was reached
