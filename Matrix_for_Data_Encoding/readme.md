- Markdown notes on Russian
####  Machine Learning tools  
- ML models LinearRegression, StandardScaler, Pipeline
- ML metrics r2_score
#### Conclusions
- The project is completed
- The applicability of matriх for data encryption was verified
- An algorithm for data transformation was created
- Required R2 metric was reached for the data before and after the transformation
