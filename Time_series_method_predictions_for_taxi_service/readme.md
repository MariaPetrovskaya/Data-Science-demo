#### Title
- Time series method predictions for taxi service 
- Training project from Yandex Practicum (INO СPE «Yandex EdTEch»), Data Scientist specialist
#### Description of the project
- Dataset: CSV from Taxi company, historical data, taxi orders at airports
- Task: to build a model for prediction number of taxi orders in the next hour (in the future)  
- Regression task
- For customer was important: quality of prediction
- Time series dataset
#### Main tools 
- Jupiter notebook, Python and Markdown
- Markdown notes on Russian
####  Machine Learning tools  
- ML models LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, CatBoostRegressor, StandardScaler
- ML metrics rmse, mean_squared_error
#### Conclusions
- The project is completed
- Different Machine learning models were trained and compared, the model with the best metric was selected
- The selected Machine learning model was tested on a test dataset
- Required metric was reached
