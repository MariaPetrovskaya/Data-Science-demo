#### Title
- Gold recovery Mashine learning model
- Training project from Yandex Practicum (INO СPE «Yandex EdTEch»), Data Scientist specialist
#### Description of the project
- Datasets: 3 CSV files with mining and cleaning parameters
- Task: model should predict the recovery rate of gold from gold ore  
- Regression task
- For customer was important: to optimize production, to avoid unprofitable characteristics
- 3 datasets with overlapping features
#### Main tools 
- Jupiter notebook, Python and Markdown
- Markdown notes on Russian
####  Machine Learning tools  
- ML models LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, DummyRegressor, StandardScaler 
- ML metrics mean_squared_error, sMAPE (customer metric created using make_scorer)
#### Conclusions
- The project is completed
- Different Machine learning models were trained and compared, the model with the best metric was selected
- The selected Machine learning model was tested on a test dataset
- Required metric was reached
